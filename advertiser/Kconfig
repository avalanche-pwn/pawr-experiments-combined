        Advertiser will reserve NUM_REGIStER_SLOTS from the beginning, goig
        from subevent[0] rsp_slot[0] upwards for allowing new devices to inform
        about their presence. Connecting devices should select one of the slots
        at random. This is to prevent interference between multipledevices
        connecting at the same rsp_slot.
